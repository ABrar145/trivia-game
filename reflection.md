1. Can I explain what my code does?
My code handles form submissions and manages game sessions. It saves scores, updates the UI, and uses cookies to remember the username. The handleFormSubmit function processes form inputs, while newPlayer resets the game for a new player.

2. What was my coding process?
I started by planning each function, then created a new branch for this feature. I coded one function at a time, tested it, and then combined them. My process was step-by-step to keep things simple.

3. What challenges did I have?
I had trouble making sure the username and score displayed correctly. Sometimes the cookie didn’t update as expected, so I had to fix the order of function calls to make it work.

4. What would I do differently now?
I would add small tests for each function first to make sure they work individually. I’d also add better error handling to make the code more reliable and easier to debug.
